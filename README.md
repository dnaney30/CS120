Introduction to Final Game
As per say in my game document, I decided to take what we learned from the slide and catch game and create a Pong game! This is the most basic of games, as Pong was one of the first video games to ever catch the public’s eye! This game is nowhere near perfect; however, I did get the basics to work. 
 
 I learned  how to improvise the ball and paddle speed, was kind of cool to get that part to work
 I took a lot of components over from slide and catch, so trying to code the paddles to the left and right was challenging 
 I would probably sleep instead of pulling all nighters next time 
 I kept it very close to the design document
 By forcing myself to try and get the best possible grade

 I’m sure you teacher(s) need no introduction to this game. You have 45 seconds to score the most points, good luck!
